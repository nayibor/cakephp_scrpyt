# What is this


This is a experimental cakephp component for  scrypt based on  
[Domblack scrypt php library](https://github.com/DomBlack/php-scrypt)



#Notes

As with all cryptographic code; it is recommended that you use a tried/tested library rather than rolling out using this one.  
Bcrypt is a tried and tested kdf function which has been in used,tested,poked,strengthened for many years .  It's recommended that you use that one.   
This is for demonstration purposes of kdf functions only.
