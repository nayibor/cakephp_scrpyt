This is a cakephp component i   made in php as  a wrapper around the  php scrypt script 
https://github.com/DomBlack/php-scrypt
 which in itself is a wrapper around Colin Percival's scrypt implementation. 
please this is just some fun stuff i made in my spare time and as part of an extremmely  trivial application. 
i wanted to try out  hashing using a  kdf (key derivitive function).
i am not a cryptographic expert  by a long long short so dont use this for production stuff. 
Bcrypt is a tried and tested kdf function which has been in used/tested/poked/strenghtened for many years.
they are many libraries available for it with best practices added.  

 As with all cryptographic code; it is recommended that you use a tried and
tested library rather than rolling out using this one .
please read the link below if you arent sure of this
